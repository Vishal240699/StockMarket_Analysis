The dataset was scraped from http://finviz.com/screener.ashx with all the filters selected. You will have to manually select all the filters
or else you can use the following link - https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=152&c=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69

Notice - The dataset was scraped, not downloaded as the download option was unavailable for FREE users.

So, I suggest Data Miner Pro as the scraping tool as it really helped when I wasted almost 2 days on searching a way to scrap the data.
Few websites don't allow the scraping of data from their websites so if you try and get permanent a ban on your IP address,
It will soley be your own responsibility.

The dataset I use here was downloaded on 30/09/2020.
