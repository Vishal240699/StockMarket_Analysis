Few packages must be insalled before going on with the project.

Open R and install the following packages
install.packages("XML")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("zoo")

After installing load the libraries in the current R setup
library(XML)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(zoo)


Some info regarding the libraries-

XML - XML is a file format which shares both the file format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets,
and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. It stands for Extensible Markup Language (XML).
Similar to HTML it contains markup tags. But unlike HTML where the markup tag describes structure of the page,
in xml the markup tags describe the meaning of the data contained into the file.

ggplot2 - ggplot2 will help us to create beautiful graphs and visualizations from our data

dplyr - One of the core packages of the tidyverse in R,dplyr is primarily a set of
functions designed to enable dataframe manipulation in an intuitive, user-friendly way

reshape2 - reshape2 is an R package written by Hadley Wickham that makes it easy to transform data between wide and long formats.

zoo - The zoo package interfaces to all other time series packages on CRAN. This makes it easy to pass the time series objects between zoo
& other time series packages. The zoo package is an infrastructure that tries to do all basic things well, but it doesn't provide modeling functionality.
